What about "sequences" in tactics? not only spawning stem cells and trying to attach them to sequences; 
but remembering *temporal* patterns as sensors/terminals? 

"check-check-discovered fork" 

"opposition-force king to move - protect pawn to promotion" <--- could this be condensed to one sensor? (basically reverse engineering script nodes). Or is this implicitly done by script nodes? 

I am thinking if this opens for different temporal level thinking (steps ahead, thinking fast/slow) - does this  tie into "wire together fire together"? should I experiment with different tick resolutions? not necessarily micro tics, tics and so on, 
basically we can have a high resolution tick that we mod every x timesteps for different patterns. 

could we create whole network structures with these levels in mind, somehow converging/syncing different depth of the hierarchy at certain depths? does this add anything?
